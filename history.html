          No one is absolutely sure who first had the idea of an official Formula One World Championship, but the credit is
          generally given to the Marquis Antonio Brivio-Sforza, who had been elected to represent Italy at the FIA in 1946.
          He was a passionate racing man from Milan, a former bobsleigh gold medallist and Grand Prix racer who scored third
          place podiums at Monaco in 1935 and Nurburgring in 1936. In 1949 it was confirmed that the FIA Formula One World
          Championship would be inaugurated for 1950, with a World Champion elected at the end of the season.

          Initially, when the concept of the new racing category was voted through by the CSI in 1946, it was felt that the
          expression 'formula' best summarised a racing division, and it was called Formula Internationale, but some thought
          t had also been given the name Formula A. In the end it was decided that Formula 1 was the more apposite title and
          that it would immediately be recognised for what it was, the premier formula.

          For the first championship, there would be seven rounds: Britain, Monaco, America, Switzerland, Belgium, France
          and Italy. The American round was the famed Indianapolis 500, which would be included up until 1960 as a political
          ploy designed to give the series a suitably international flavour. In practice there was virtually zero crossover
          of drivers; that would not happen until Jack Brabham took his Cooper to Indy in 1961 and triggered the 'European';
          wave that would transform racing on the famous oval. There was only one championship, for drivers (the championship
          for constructors was not added until 1958), for which points would be awarded on the basis of eight for a win, six
          for second place, four for third, three for fourth and two for fifth, with an extra point awarded for fastest lap.
